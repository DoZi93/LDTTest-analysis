# LDTTest-analysis

Repository containing the workflow implemented for analysing the data obtained from the Light/Dark Transition Test using the DanioVision Chamber by Noldus. It is a popular test method used in behavioural ecotoxicology to characterize effects of neurotoxic chemicals on *Danio rerio*.

## Structure
The workflow is separated into four different scripts, each serving one different purpose within the analysis workflow.

  1. Import-Script - For combining the raw data output with the metainformation, resulting in a dataframe combining both  
  2. Outlier-Script - For dropping fish from the analysis which were lost by the cameras during the tracking procedure
  3. Filtering-Script - Preprocessing and combining all time series which the user wishs to compare
  4. Analysis-Script - Calculating the hierarchical linkage between the preprocessed time series and visualize the results
